***Work in progress***
My first big project. The game based on Brackeys' guide, after I've finished the guide I wanted to work on it more, adding some features and graphics on my own.
Did this game mainly to practice on my abilities with C# and Unity.
It was a great experience with Unity and C# and amazing first step in the game development world.
Would like to hear from anyone who check out the game for feedback ☺
